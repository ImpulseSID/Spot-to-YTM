## YouTube Music Authentication (browser.json)

This project uses your browser session headers for YouTube Music authentication.

**How to get your browser headers:**

1. Open [music.youtube.com](https://music.youtube.com) and log in.
2. Open Developer Tools (Ctrl+Shift+I) and go to the "Network" tab.
3. Filter by `/browse` in the search bar.
4. Find a POST request to `/browse` (Status 200).
5. Right-click the request â†’ Copy â†’ Copy request headers.

**Create `browser.json`:**

- Run:
  ```bash
  ytmusicapi browser
  ```
  Paste your copied headers when prompted.  
  This will create a `browser.json` file in your project directory.

Alternatively, in Python:

```python
import ytmusicapi
ytmusicapi.setup(filepath="browser.json", headers_raw="<headers copied above>")
```

Your credentials remain valid as long as your YouTube Music session is active (about 2 years unless you log out).

---

## Usage

Run the transfer script and follow the prompts:

```bash
python transfer.py
```

You will be asked for your Spotify playlist URL/ID, and for the YouTube Music playlist name and description (optional). The script will migrate your playlist and report any tracks that could not be matched.

**How matching works:**

- Each track is searched on YouTube Music using a strict fuzzy match.
- If strict matching fails, a relaxed search is attempted.
- Relaxed matches are indicated in the output as `ðŸŸ¡ Relaxed match`.
- Tracks that cannot be matched are reported at the end.

---

## Notes

- Tracks are transferred **one by one** for reliability; batch transfer is not used.
- Fuzzy matching is used to find the best possible match for each track.
- If a track cannot be found with strict matching, a relaxed search is attempted and reported.
- Some tracks may not be found or matched accurately due to naming or availability differences.
- Your credentials and browser headers are required for authentication.
